## The m5pl-scuffed mechanical keyboard build guide

The m5pl-scuffed is a handwired mechanical keyboard made for enthusiasts on the cheap.<br>
The total cost of the keyboard should be around 150 USD.<br>
Let's get started!

## Parts

To build this keyboard, you'll need:

- A 60% keyboard case and plate
- Wires (these can be stolen from a USB cable and such)
- Enough diodes for all of the keys on the board
- A SAMD based Arduino or compatbile MCU, I'm using an Arduino Nano 33 IoT
- Mechanical key switches, these are based on preference but I personally picked Akko CS Red Rose Switches.
